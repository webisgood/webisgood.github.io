# **About the "PROFESSIONAL ME"**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I'm deeply interested in the field of VLSI Design and Architecture but I'm also curious about the design 
of Controllers for Complex Systems such as Robots. Even in the VLSI flow cycle, I picture myself working 
on either the Architecture of the Chip at a higher level or converting the transistor circuits to Chip 
Layout in the Physical Design phase, as the former has a lot of scope for innovation and creativity going 
forward while the latter's growth would determine the further miniaturization of chips in the future.
