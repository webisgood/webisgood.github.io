description: In this project, first I have developed the model for numerical inverse kinematics of a 
             2R robot. After that, using this numerical IK model, I have made the 2R robot joints to
             trace out some trajectories like straight line, circule, square, etc. Finally, a tree-type
             robot is modeled is modeled in MATLAB and its numerical IK model is also developed.
