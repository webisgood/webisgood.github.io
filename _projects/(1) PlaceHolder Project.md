description: In this project, we have first modelled the physics of an actual AUV using Simulink Blocks.
             Later, we designed a PID controller for controlling the motion of the AUV model and tuned the  parameters using the inbuilt PID tuner app in Simulink. Further, we have modelled the physics 
             of the AUV in terms of a state equation and designed the state-fed LQR controller for this 
             equation.
