description: In this project, we first built a single-cycled pipeline processor basing on MIPS Instruction
             Set Architecture. Then, we inserted the pipeline registers and divided the execution of each instruction into 5 steps. Finally, to handle the hazards, we implemented a hazard detection and stalling unit, a flushing unit, and a data forwarding unit.
