description: In this project, we first built and trained a CNN model for classifying emotions displayed
             in facial images. Then, we went on build and train a model for detecting emotions in speech
             signals. Finally, we tested the performance of both these models on a video dataset by
             extracting video frames and audio signals from a video and analysing the frame-wise display of
             emotions in a single video and emotion detected in the audio!
