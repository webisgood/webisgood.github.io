name: Design of an 8-bit by 8-bit Unsigned Array Multiplier using 180 nm technology node
tools: [Cadence Virtuoso]

description: In this project, we first designed AND gate, half-adder & full-adder modules using transmission
             gate logic style. Later, we used these two modules to build the array multiplier. Finally, we 
             tested out this designed array multiplier to evaluate the worst case propagation delay and power dissipation
