description: In this project, I have developed a working model for the inverse kinematics of 
             a general tree-type robot. As a precursor, I also developed the inverse kinematics 
             model for a simple 2R-robot and used it to plan its trajectory.

# Humanoid Robot Control

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
