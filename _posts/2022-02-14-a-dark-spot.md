October 16th, 2021

I am back again with another snapshot of my life. It was dark in the morning with dense clouds surrounding the sky. A familiar musical sound was echoing from a distant place. I woke up slowly only to get disheartened to find out that it’s time. As I got up, I gave a small peek underneath my bed. There it was, a mechanical robot dog capable of walking just as an actual dog does. It had four legs and a front camera. It really is a wonderful thing. My friend Pavan entrusted it to me as his room is already filled up. As I was preparing to go to breakfast, my friend Rahul came by my room.

“Good Morning, Sanjeev.”

“Yeah, Good Morning.”

“Are you headed for breakfast? If so, are you interested in joining me? We could play TT after we’re done.”
As soon as these words seeped into my head, I felt so happy that I could eat ten idli non-stop. I left the room asap but little did I know what time has kept in its store for me.


After finishing these tasks, I went to my room only to find Pavan waiting near my room’s door with something very dear to me, my brand new TT racquet. I was shocked at this sight.

“What’re you up to Pavan?”

“The same that you did.”

Saying this he started slamming it onto the wall. Before I could stop him, it was damaged beyond repair.

“WHY YOU?!!!”

“DO YOU SEE NOW? THIS IS HOW I FEEL.”

“WHAT’RE YOU BLABBERING ABOUT?”

“Acting Smart, Huh? Of course I’m talking about my project.”

It was as if my mother splashed a bucket of water to wake me up. I immediately rushed inside my room. All my things were littered here and there on the floor, there were muddy pawprints on my bedsheet and …there it was; the robot dog with wires dangling from either side, its camera cracked and legs broken. Although an hour ago this room had hosted a cacophony, now it’s as quiet as the cemetery at night. Pavan broke the silence :

“Do you see now? FYI it costs a fortune!! To think someone like you would be able to pull off a responsible task is my fault.”

Saying these words, he left me alone in the same silent storm that prevailed before.
