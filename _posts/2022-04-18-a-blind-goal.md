O Lord, where are we headed

With your ball of emerald and sapphire

Put at risk by your sons puppeted

By riches' and politics' and brains' desire.

---

O Lord, where are we headed

With a never ending thirst provoked

In the blood of their kindred

Your androids' fists are getting soaked.

---

O Lord, where are we headed

With shades of yellow covering the land

And not a sip of water as dreaded

It is time that you took command.
