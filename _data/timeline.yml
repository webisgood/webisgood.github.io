  GPA: 8.93/10
  description: In my college, I had the opportunity of working in one of the most active clubs on

               I have also enrolled in the Minor Programme Automation & Robotics at my college, which 
               gave me a flavour of different design projects related to the field.

               drastically after all ðŸ™ƒ.

  description: In school, I was one of those typical nerds you would find in movies. I had a strong sense
               of abiding by the rules and a decent hardworking nature. Right from then I just knew that 
               Social Sciences are not my cup of tea ðŸ˜….
