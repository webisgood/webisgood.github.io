               In my college, I had the opportunity of working in one of the most active clubs on 
               campus which is the Automation & Robotics Club (the "ARC" ðŸ¤–). I have learnt the 
               basics of many technical skills like Coding, 3D Modelling, tinkering with 
               electronics, and so on while working in this club.
               I have also enrolled into the Minor Programme in Automation & Robotics at my college, which 
               gave me a flavour of different design projects related to the field.
